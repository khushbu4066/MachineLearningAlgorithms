# MachineLearningAlgorithms
This repository contains Machine Learning related algorithms, which I'm going to practice in my ML journey.

Before going into deep dive, let's learn some basics of Machine Learning:

**MACHINE LEARNING** is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly programmed. Machine learning is a growing technology which enables computers to learn automatically from past data. Machine learning uses various algorithms for building mathematical models and making predictions using historical data or information. Currently, it is being used for various tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, email filtering, Facebook auto-tagging, recommender system, and many more.
In the real world, we are surrounded by humans who can learn everything from their experiences with their learning capability, and we have computers or machines which work on our instructions. But can a machine also learn from experiences or past data like a human does? So here comes the role of Machine Learning.

Machine Learning is said as a subset of artificial intelligence that is mainly concerned with the development of algorithms which allow a computer to learn from the data and past experiences on their own. The term machine learning was first introduced by Arthur Samuel in 1959.

 A machine has the ability to learn if it can improve its performance by gaining more data.

 **NEED FOR MACHINE LEARNING**
The need for machine learning is increasing day by day. The reason behind the need for machine learning is that it is capable of doing tasks that are too complex for a person to implement directly. As a human, we have some limitations as we cannot access the huge amount of data manually, so for this, we need some computer systems and here comes the machine learning to make things easy for us.
The importance of machine learning can be easily understood by its uses cases, Currently, machine learning is used in self-driving cars, cyber fraud detection, face recognition, and friend suggestion by Facebook, etc. Various top companies such as Netflix and Amazon have build machine learning models that are using a vast amount of data to analyze the user interest and recommend product accordingly.

**CLASSIFICATION OF MACHINE LEARNING**
1. Supervised learning
2. Unsupervised learning
3. Reinforcement learning

**SUPERVISED LEARNING**

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning method in which we provide sample labeled data to the machine learning system in order to train it, and on that basis, it predicts the output. The system creates a model using labeled data to understand the datasets and learn about each data, once the training and processing are done then we test the model by providing a sample data to check whether it is predicting the exact output or not.
The goal of supervised learning is to map input data with the output data. It is based on supervision, and it is the same as when a student learns things in the supervision of the teacher. The example of supervised learning is spam filtering.

**SUPERVISED LEARNING CAN BE CLASSIFIED INTO 2 TYPES**

1. Classification
2. Regression

**UNSUPERVISED LEARNING**

Unsupervised learning is a learning method in which a machine learns without any supervision.
The training is provided to the machine with the set of data that has not been labeled, classified, or categorized, and the algorithm needs to act on that data without any supervision. The goal of unsupervised learning is to restructure the input data into new features or a group of objects with similar patterns.
In unsupervised learning, we don't have a predetermined result. The machine tries to find useful insights from the huge amount of data. 

**UNSUPERVISED LEARNING FURTHER CLASSIFIED INTO 2 TYPES**

1. Clustering
2. Association

**REINFORCEMENT LEARNING**

Reinforcement learning is a feedback-based learning method, in which a learning agent gets a reward for each right action and gets a penalty for each wrong action. The agent learns automatically with these feedbacks and improves its performance. In reinforcement learning, the agent interacts with the environment and explores it. The goal of an agent is to get the most reward points, and hence, it improves its performance.
The robotic dog, which automatically learns the movement of his arms, is an example of Reinforcement learning.

**REINFORCEMENT LEARNING CAN BE CLASSIFIED INTO 2 TYPES**

1. Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
2. Model-Free Reinforcement Learning
